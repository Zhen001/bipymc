Bayesian Inference for PYthon using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BiPyMc).

BiPyMc contains short example implementations of common Markov chain Monte Carlo routines.  This package also contains Bayesian optimization routines for 1) finding optimal parameter values when the objective function is too costly for MCMC to be feasible and 2) generating initial parameter guesses for MCMC if the objective function is inexpensive.

This package is intended for educational use only.

Try [emcee](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3665),
[pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/), or Dakota for `real` MCMC applications, however, one can
use BiPyMc as a starting point for implementing their own fancy MCMC samplers.

Implemented Example MCMC Methods
---------------------------------

- Metropolis-Hastings
- Adaptive Metropolis (AM)
- Differential Evolution Metropolis (DE-MC)
- Delayed Rejection Metropolis
- Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM)
