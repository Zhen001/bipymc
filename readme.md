Bayesian Inference for PYthon using Marcov Chain Monte Carlo (BiPyMc)

BiPyMc contains short example implementations of common Markov chain Monte Carlo routines.
This package is intended for educational use only.

The author suggests emcee, pymc3, or Dakota for `real` MCMC applications, however, one can
use BiPyMc as a starting point for implementing their own fancy MCMC samplers.
