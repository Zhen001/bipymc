About
======

Bayesian Inference for PYthon using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BiPyMc).

BiPyMc contains implementations of common Markov chain Monte Carlo routines.

This package also contains Bayesian optimization routines for 1) finding optimal parameter values when the objective function is too costly for MCMC to be feasible and 2) generating initial parameter guesses for MCMC if the objective function is inexpensive.

This package is intended for educational use only.

Try [emcee](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.3665),
[pymc3](https://docs.pymc.io/), or Dakota for alternative MCMC implementations; however, one can
use BiPyMc as a starting point for implementing their own fancy MCMC samplers.

Implemented MCMC Methods
---------------------------------

- Metropolis-Hastings
- Adaptive Metropolis (AM)
- Differential Evolution Metropolis (DE-MC)  (Parallel implementation)
- Differential Evolution Adaptive Metropolis (DREAM)  (Parallel implementation)
- Delayed Rejection Metropolis
- Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM)

## Example: Sample Bimodal Gaussian Distribution with DREAM

### Included Tests:
- `tests/test_100dgauss.py`: 100 Dimensional normal distribution test.  Shows improved performance of DREAM in high dimensions.
- `tests/test_dblgauss.py`: Ensures DREAM and DE-MC samplers handle multi-modal distributions.  Demonstrates DRAM and AM limitations.
- `tests/test_banana.py`: Ensures all MCMC methods obtain correct samples from non-linear, distorted-gaussian distribution.


Implemented Bayesian Optimization Methods
---------------------------------

- Gaussian Process with Thompson sampling  (Parallel implementation)
